It is commonly referred to as \"the cloud\".\\n\\n', 'source': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing'}, page_content='Cloud computing is \"a paradigm for enabling network access to a scalable and elastic pool of shareable physical or virtual resources with self-service provisioning and administration on-demand,\" according to ISO. It is commonly referred to as \"the cloud\".\\n\\n\\n== Characteristics ==\\nIn 2011, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) identified five \"essential characteristics\" for cloud systems. Below are the exact definitions according to NIST:\\n\\nOn-demand self-service: \"A consumer can unilaterally provision computing capabilities, such as server time and network storage, as needed automatically without requiring human interaction with each service provider.\"\\nBroad network access: \"Capabilities are available over the network and accessed through standard mechanisms that promote use by heterogeneous thin or thick client platforms (e.g., mobile phones, tablets, laptops, and workstations).\"\\nResource pooling: \" The provider\\'s computing resources are pooled to serve multiple consumers using a multi-tenant model, with different physical and virtual resources dynamically assigned and reassigned according to consumer demand.\"\\nRapid elasticity: \"Capabilities can be elastically provisioned and released, in some cases automatically, to scale rapidly outward and inward commensurate with demand. To the consumer, the capabilities available for provisioning often appear unlimited and can be appropriated in any quantity at any time.\"\\nMeasured service: \"Cloud systems automatically control and optimize resource use by leveraging a metering capability at some level of abstraction appropriate to the type of service (e.g., storage, processing, bandwidth, and active user accounts). Resource usage can be monitored, controlled, and reported, providing transparency for both the provider and consumer of the utilized service.\\nBy 2023, the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) had expanded and refined the list.\\n\\n\\n== History ==\\n\\nThe history of cloud computing extends to the 1960s, with the initial concepts of time-sharing becoming popularized via remote job entry (RJE). The \"data center\" model, where users submitted jobs to operators to run on mainframes, was predominantly used during this era. This was a time of exploration and experimentation with ways to make large-scale computing power available to more users through time-sharing, optimizing the infrastructure, platform, and applications, and increasing efficiency for end users.\\nThe \"cloud\" metaphor for virtualized services dates to 1994, when it was used by General Magic for the universe of \"places\" that mobile agents in the Telescript environment could \"go\". The metaphor is credited to David Hoffman, a General Magic communications specialist, based on its long-standing use in networking and telecom. The expression cloud computing became more widely known in 1996 when Compaq Computer Corporation drew up a business plan for future computing and the Internet. The company\\'s ambition was to supercharge sales with \"cloud computing-enabled applications\". The business plan foresaw that online consumer file storage would likely be commercially successful. As a result, Compaq decided to sell server hardware to internet service providers.\\nIn the 2000s, the application of cloud computing began to take shape with the establishment of Amazon Web Services (AWS) in 2002, which allowed developers to build applications independently. In 2006 Amazon Simple Storage Service, known as Amazon S3, and the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) were released. In 2008 NASA\\'s development of the first open-source software for deploying private and hybrid clouds.\\nThe following decade saw the launch of various cloud services. In 2010, Microsoft launched Microsoft Azure, and Rackspace Hosting and NASA initiated an open-source cloud-software project, OpenStack. IBM introduced the IBM SmartCloud framework in 2011, and Oracle announced the Oracle Cloud in 2012. In December 2019, Amazon launched AWS Outposts, a '), Document(metadata={'title': 'Blue–green deployment', 'summary': 'In software engineering, blue–green deployment is a method of installing changes to a web, app, or database server by swapping alternating production and staging servers.', 'source': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue%E2%80%93green_deployment'}, page_content='In software engineering, blue–green deployment is a method of installing changes to a web, app, or database server by swapping alternating production and staging servers.\\n\\n\\n== Overview ==\\nIn blue–green deployments, two servers are maintained: a \"blue\" server and a \"green\" server. At any given time, only one server is handling requests (e.g., being pointed to by the DNS). For example, public requests may be routed to the blue server, making it the production server and the green server the staging server, which can only be accessed on a private network. Changes are installed on the non-live server, which is then tested through the private network to verify the changes work as expected. Once verified, the non-live server is swapped with the live server, effectively making the deployed changes live.\\nUsing this method of software deployment offers the ability to quickly roll back to a previous state if anything goes wrong. This rollback is achieved by simply routing traffic back to the previous live server, which still does not have the deployed changes. An additional benefit to the blue–green method of deployment is the reduced downtime for the server. Because requests are routed instantly from one server to the other, there is ideally no period where requests will be unfulfilled.\\nThe blue–green deployment technique is often contrasted with the canary release deployment technique and it has similarities with  A/B testing.\\n\\n\\n== History ==\\nDan North and Jez Humble encountered differences between their test environments and the production environment while running Oracle WebLogic Server for a client sometime around 2005. To ensure safe deployment, they introduced a method where the new application version was deployed alongside the live system. This approach allowed for thorough testing and easy rollback in case of issues. The team initially considered naming these environments A and B but decided against it to avoid the perception that one was primary and the other secondary. They instead chose color-based names like blue, green, orange, and yellow, eventually using only blue and green since \"having two was sufficient\". This naming convention was adopted while working on the original Continuous delivery book published in 2010  and became a common term in the industry afterwards.\\n\\n\\n== Benefits and challenges ==\\nBlue–green deployment is widely recognized for its ability to reduce downtime during application updates and minimize the risk of introducing defects into production environments. By maintaining two separate environments—blue (the current live environment) and green (the environment with the updated version)—traffic can easily be switched between the two, ensuring that updates are rolled out without disrupting users. This method enables quick rollback in case of deployment failure, thus improving overall system resilience and user experience.\\nWhile blue–green deployment reduces risks during updates, it also requires additional resources since two environments need to be maintained simultaneously. The cost of running duplicate infrastructure, even temporarily, can be prohibitive for smaller organizations. Furthermore, complex database migrations may pose challenges, as the system must ensure that both the blue and green environments have consistent data. Solutions to these issues often involve using database migration tools that allow for backward compatibility between environments.\\n\\n\\n== Implementation ==\\nThere are several approaches to implementing blue–green deployments, each offering varying levels of automation and ease of use depending on the platform and tools available.\\n\\n\\n=== AWS CodeDeploy ===\\nAWS CodeDeploy facilitates blue–green deployments by automating the entire process across services such as Amazon EC2 and AWS Lambda. The service shifts traffic between the old (blue) environment and the new (green) environment, minimizing downtime and ensuring a smooth transition. AWS CodeDeploy also allows the use of lifecycle '), Document(metadata={'title': 'Serverless computing', 'summary': 'Serverless computing is \"a cloud service category where the customer can use different cloud capability types without the customer having to provision, deploy and manage either hardware or software resources, other than providing customer application code or providing customer data.

Emphasis should shift from strict definitions and specific technologies to adopting a serverless mindset, focusing on leveraging serverless solutions to address business challenges.\\nServerless computing does not eliminate complexity but shifts much of it from the operations team to the development team. However, this shift is not absolute, as operations teams continue to manage aspects such as identity and access management (IAM), networking, security policies, and cost optimization. Additionally, while breaking down applications into finer-grained components can increase management complexity, the relationship between granularity and management difficulty is not strictly linear. There is often an optimal level of modularization where the benefits outweigh the added management overhead.\\nAccording to Yan Cui, serverless should be adopted only when it helps to deliver customer value faster. And while adopting, organizations should take small steps and de-risk along the way.\\n\\n\\n== Challenges ==\\nServerless applications are prone to fallacies of distributed computing. In addition, they are prone to the following fallacies:\\n\\nVersioning is simple\\nCompensating transactions always work\\nObservability is optional\\n\\n\\n=== Monitoring and debugging ===\\nMonitoring and debugging serverless applications can present unique challenges due to their distributed, event-driven nature and proprietary environments. Traditional tools may fall short, making it difficult to track execution flows across services. However, modern solutions such as distributed tracing tools (e.g., AWS X-Ray, Datadog), centralized logging, and cloud-agnostic observability platforms are mitigating these challenges. Emerging technologies like OpenTelemetry, AI-powered anomaly detection, and serverless-specific frameworks are further improving visibility and root cause analysis. While challenges persist, advancements in monitoring and debugging tools are steadily addressing these limitations.\\n\\n\\n=== Security ===\\nAccording to OWASP, serverless applications are vulnerable to variations of traditional  attacks, insecure code, and some serverless-specific attacks (like Denial of Wallet). So, the risks have changed and attack prevention requires a shift in mindset.\\n\\n\\n=== Vendor lock-in ===\\nServerless computing is provided as a third-party service. Applications and software that run in the serverless environment are by default locked to a specific cloud vendor. This issue is exacerbated in serverless computing, as with its increased level of abstraction, public vendors only allow customers to upload code to a FaaS platform without the authority to configure underlying environments. More importantly, when considering a more complex workflow that includes Backend-as-a-Service (BaaS), a BaaS offering can typically only natively trigger a FaaS offering from the same provider. This makes the workload migration in serverless computing virtually impossible. Therefore, considering how to design and deploy serverless workflows from a multi-cloud perspective could mitigate th'), Document(metadata={'title': 'Elastic cloud storage', 'summary': \"An elastic cloud is a cloud computing offering that provides variable service levels based on changing needs.\\nElasticity is an attribute that can be applied to most cloud services.

These\\nwary organizations can achieve some of the benefits of cloud computing by\\nadopting private\\ncloud\\ntechnologies.\\nAn alternative form of the elastic cloud has been offered\\nby vendors such as EMC  and\\nIBM,\\nwhereby the service is based around an enterprise's own infrastructure but\\nstill retains elements of elasticity and the potential to bill by consumption.\\n\\n\\n== Description ==\\nElasticity in cloud computing is the ability for the\\norganization to adjust its storage requirements in terms of capacity and\\nprocessing with respect to operational requirements. This has the following\\nbenefits:\\nOperational Benefits - Services\\ncan be acquired quickly, meaning that the evolving requirements of the business\\ncan be addressed almost immediately, giving an organization a potential agility\\nadvantage. A properly implemented elastic system will provision/de-provision\\naccording to application demands, so if a particular business has activity\\nspikes then the provision can be enabled to match the demand and the capacity\\ncan be re-allocated.\\nResearch and Development (R&D) Projects - R&D activities are no\\nlonger hindered by a requirement to secure a capex budget prior to a project\\nstarting. Capability can simply be provisioned from the cloud and released at\\nthe end of the exercise.\\nTesting and Deployment - With\\nmost large-scale projects a size test needs to be performed prior to final\\nrollout. By taking advantage of the elasticity of the cloud and creating a full-scale\\navatar of the proposed production system, realistic data and traffic volumes\\ncan be provisioned and released as needed.  \\nExpensive Resources Allocated - This will normally apply only\\nin the context where a customer is applying at least some of their own servers\\nas part of a cloud infrastructure, specifically where a business (for\\nperformance reasons) has decided to invest in solid-state storage as opposed to\\nspinning platters.

This ensures that the system can handle varying workloads and provides continuous availability, even during high-demand periods.\\nCost-effectiveness: By eliminating the need for physical infrastructure and reducing ongoing server maintenance costs, Cloud-Based Secure File Transfer services offer significant cost savings compared to traditional on-premises services. Cloud providers typically offer pay-as-you-go pricing models, where users only pay for the resources they use, further optimizing costs.\\nSecurity and compliance: Cloud-Based Secure File Transfer products offer strong security measures, including end-to-end encryption, key management, detailed logging, and auditing. These services are often compliant with industry regulations such as HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act), GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation), and SOC 2 (System and Organization Controls), ensuring that data transfers meet necessary security and privacy standards.\\n\\n\\n== Cloud-Based Secure File Transfer providers ==\\n\\n\\n== Uses ==\\nCloud-Based Secure File Transfer is used across various industries to securely transfer sensitive data and integrate into business workflows. In healthcare, Cloud-Based Secure File Transfer is essential for securely transferring electronic Protected Health Information (ePHI), ensuring compliance with regulations like HIPAA. In financial institutions, it is used to protect sensitive financial data during transfer, maintaining privacy and security. Data analytics also benefits from Cloud-Based Secure File Transfer, offering a secure and efficient method for transferring large datasets between systems or partners.\\nTechnically, Cloud-Based Secure File Transfer is often integrated into enterprise workflows through automated file transfers, using scripting or APIs. It also plays a key role in cloud backup and disaster recovery, ensuring that files are securely transferred and stored in cloud environments, which supports business continuity.\\nHowever, businesses must address certain implementation challenges. Despite its secure design, Cloud-Based Secure File Transfer is not immune to risks such as misconfigured SSH keys, improper access control, or inadequate encryption.\\nRegular security audits and careful co'), Document(metadata={'title': 'Cilium (computing)', 'summary': 'Cilium is a cloud native technology for networking, observability, and security.

The startup initially developed a platform for live video streaming and geolocation data to assist emergency call centers.\\nThe company rebranded to Carbyne in early 2018 – a name referencing an extremely strong allotrope of carbon. By 2018 Carbyne had raised about $24 million in venture funding (including backing from Founders Fund, the first Israeli startup in that fund’s portfolio) and was valued near $100 million.\\nIn April 2019, the company began collaborating with Cisco, the network equipment giant, to incorporate their hardware into its systems. Two months later, Carbyne announced a partnership with Google to integrate Android phone location services into emergency command centers across Mexico.\\nCarbyne established its headquarters in New York City in October 2019 while maintaining R&D operations in Tel Aviv, and it expanded with offices in the United States, Mexico, Europe, India, and Ukraine.\\nIn 2025, it secured a $100 million funding round led by strategic partners like AT&T, and reported deployments in roughly 300 emergency response centers worldwide.\\n\\n\\n== Products ==\\nCarbyne develops cloud-based “Next Generation 911” (NG911) solutions aimed at modernizing emergency communication. Its platform enables real-time transmission of rich data from callers to public safety answering points (PSAPs). For example, when a distress call is made, Carbyne’s system can provide the 911 dispatcher with the caller’s precise GPS location, live video feed from the caller’s smartphone camera, audio streaming, text messaging, and other telemetry in parallel with the voice call. The company offers both an app-based service and an app-free option. With the Carbyne mobile app (previously called “C-Now”), users can pre-install it on iOS or Android to automatically send video and location data during an emergency call.\\nAlternatively, Carbyne’s web-based feature (known as “C-Lite”) allows a 911 center to text an auto-generated URL link to a caller, which when tapped activates the phone’s camera and streams video and location to the dispatcher – all without requiring the caller to have any app installed. Both methods are cloud-native and work with legacy 911 infrastructure by creating an over-the-top data channel, enabling quick deployment with minimal changes to existing call centers. Carbyne claims its technology can significantly improve response efficiency (reducing emergency response times by up to 65% on average) by providing first responders with critical situational information before they arrive on scene. The platform also includes capabilities for indoor positioning (to locate callers inside buildings) and integration of additional data sources such as IoT sensors or surveillance feeds to give a comprehensive picture of an incident'), Document(metadata={'title': 'Nonprofit organization', 'summary': \"A nonprofit organization (NPO), also known as a nonbusiness entity, nonprofit institution, not-for-profit organization (NFPO), or simply a nonprofit, is a non-governmental legal entity that operates for a collective, public, or social benefit, rather than to generate profit for private owners.

Based in New York City, 10gen was founded by former DoubleClick founder and CTO Dwight Merriman and former DoubleClick CEO and Gilt Groupe founder Kevin P. Ryan with former DoubleClick engineer and ShopWiki founder and CTO Eliot Horowitz and received $81 million in venture capital funding from Flybridge Capital Partners, In-Q-Tel, Intel Capital, New Enterprise Associates (NEA), Red Hat, Sequoia Capital, and Union Square Ventures. 10gen originally aimed to build a platform as a service architecture based entirely on open source components; however, the company was unable to find an existing database platform that met their principles for a cloud architecture. As a result, the company began to develop a document-oriented database system it called MongoDB. After realizing the potential of the software on its own, 10gen's team decided to scrap its cloud platform and focus on maintaining MongoDB instead. In February 2009, 10gen released MongoDB as an open source project. 10gen opened its first west coast office in August 2010, having offices in Palo Alto, Reston, London, Dublin, Barcelona, and Sydney by 2012.\\nIn September 2012, 10gen was in The Wall Street Journal's The Next Big Thing 2012.\\nOn August 27, 2013, 10gen announced that it would change its name to MongoDB Inc., associating itself more closely with what became its flagship products.\\nIn 2013, the Identification Authority of India adopted MongoDB's software to analyze registration trends for new identity documents used to obtain government benefits in India. This raised concerns of potential espionage, since at-the-time MongoDB was partially funded by the United States CIA venture capital arm, In-Q-Tel. As of 2013, there is no evidence in the public domain the CIA actually has any influence over MongoDB.\\nOn August 5, 2014, Dev Ittycheria was appointed president and chief executive officer.\\nBy 2017, MongoDB had raised $311 million in funding from venture capitalists. MongoDB filed for an initial public offering on September 21, 2017 and went public on NASDAQ that October 20. It raised $192 million, valuing the company at $1.6 billion overall. Its market capitalization varied greatly afterwards, reaching $39 billion in 2021 and coming back down to $10 billion by 2024.\\nMongoDB acquired database engine company WiredTiger in 2014, followed by database-as-a-service company MLab for $68 million in 2018.

Application developers and content providers can take advantage of close proximity to cellular subscribers and real-time RAN information.\\nMEC has been created using open standards and application programming interfaces (APIs), using common programming models, relevant tool chains and software development kits to encourage and expedite the development of new applications for the new MEC environment.\\n\\n\\n== Applications ==\\nSince MEC architecture has only recently been proposed, there are as yet very few applications that have adopted this architecture. However, many case studies have been proposed in recent articles. Some of the notable applications in mobile edge computing are computational offloading, content delivery, mobile big data analytics, edge video caching, collaborative computing, connected cars, smart venues, smart enterprises, healthcare, smartgrids, service function chaining, indoor positioning, etc.\\n\\n\\n== Current uses ==\\nSome applications which incorporate MEC were made available in 2015.

It aims at building, testing, and releasing software with greater speed and frequency. The approach helps reduce the cost, time, and risk of delivering changes by allowing for more incremental updates to applications in production. A straightforward and repeatable deployment process is important for continuous delivery.\\n\\n\\n== Principles ==\\nAccording to Neal Ford, continuous delivery adopts \"Bring the pain forward,\" tackling tough tasks early, fostering automation and swift issue detection. \\nContinuous delivery treats the commonplace notion of a deployment pipeline as a lean Poka-Yoke: a set of validations through which a piece of software must pass on its way to release. Code is compiled if necessary and then packaged by a build server every time a change is committed to a source control repository, then tested by a number of different techniques (possibly including manual testing) before it can be marked as releasable.\\nDevelopers used to a long cycle time may need to change their mindset when working in a CD environment. Any code commit may be released to customers at any point. Patterns such as feature toggles can be very useful for committing code early which is not yet ready for use by end users. Using NoSQL can eliminate the step of data migrations and schema changes, often manual steps or exceptions to a continuous delivery workflow. Other useful techniques for developing code in isolation such as code branching are not obsolete in a CD world, but must be adapted to fit the principles of CD - for example, running multiple long-lived code branches can prove impractical, as a releasable artifact must be built early in the CD process from a single code branch if it is to pass through all phases of the pipeline.\\n\\n\\n== Deployment pipeline ==\\n\\nContinuous delivery is enabled through the deployment pipeline. The purpose of the deployment pipeline has three components: visibility, feedback, and continually deploy.\\n\\nVisibility – All aspects of the delivery system including building, deploying, testing, and releasing are visible to every member of the team to promote collaboration.\\nFeedback – Team members learn of problems as soon as possible when they occur so that they are able to fix them as quickly as possible.\\nContinually deploy – Through a fully automated process, you can deploy and release any version of the software to any environment.\\n\\nAccording to Yan Cui, when it comes to serverless environments, ephemeral resources should be kept together and have their own deployment pipeline to achieve a high cohesion. However, shared resources that have a long spin-up time and landing zone should have their own separate repository, deployment pipeline and stack. \\n\\n\\n== Tools/tool types ==\\nContinuous delivery takes automation from source control all the way through production. There are various tools that help accomplish all or part of this process. These tools are part of the deployment pipeline which includes continuous delivery. The types of tools that execute various parts of the process include: continuous integration, application release automation, build automation, application lifecycle management.\\n\\n\\n== Architecting for continuous delivery ==\\nTo practice continuous delivery effectively, software applications have to meet a set of architecturally significant requirements (ASRs) such as deployability, modifiability, and testability. These ASRs require a high priority and cannot be traded off lightly.\\nMicroservices are often used when architecting for continuous delivery. The use of Microservices can increase a software system\\'s deployability and modifiability. The observed deployability improvements include: deployment independence, shorter deployment time, simpler deployment procedures, and zero downtime deployment.

Trusted execution environments can be instantiated on a computer\\'s processing components such as a central processing unit (CPU) or a graphics processing unit (GPU).  In their various implementations, TEEs can provide different levels of isolation including virtual machine, individual application, or compute functions.\\nTypically, data in use in a computer\\'s compute components and memory exists in a decrypted state and can be vulnerable to examination or tampering by unauthorized software or administrators. According to the CCC, confidential computing protects data in use through a minimum of three properties:\\n\\nData confidentiality: \"Unauthorized entities cannot view data while it is in use within the TEE\".\\nData integrity: \"Unauthorized entities cannot add, remove, or alter data while it is in use within the TEE\".\\nCode integrity: \"Unauthorized entities cannot add, remove, or alter code executing in the TEE\".\\nIn addition to trusted execution environments, remote cryptographic attestation is an essential part of confidential computing.  The attestation process assesses the trustworthiness of a system and helps ensure that confidential data is released to a TEE only after it presents verifiable evidence that it is genuine and operating with an acceptable security posture.  It allows the verifying party to assess the trustworthiness of a confidential computing environment through an \"authentic, accurate, and timely report about the software and data state\" of that environment. \"Hardware-based attestation schemes rely on a trusted hardware component and associated firmware to execute attestation routines in a secure environment\". Without attestation, a compromised system could deceive others into trusting it, claim it is running certain software in a TEE, and potentially compromise the confidentiality or integrity of the data being processed or the integrity of the trusted code.\\n\\n\\n== Technical approaches ==\\nTechnical approaches to confidential computing may vary in which software, infrastructure and administrator elements are allowed to access confidential data. The \"trust boundary,\" which circumscribes a trusted computing base (TCB), defines which elements have the potential to access confidential data, whether they are acting benignly or maliciously.  Confidential computing implementations enforce the defined trust boundary at a specific level of data isolation. The three main types of confidential computing are:\\n\\nVirtual machine isolation\\nApplication isolation'), Document(metadata={'title': 'Network Device Interface', 'summary': 'Network Device Interface (NDI) is a software specification developed by the technology company NewTek.

It enables high-definition video to be transmitted, received, and communicated over a computer network with low latency and high quality. This royalty-free specification supports frame-accurate switching, making it suitable for live video production environments.\\n\\n\\n== Technology ==\\nNDI is designed to run over gigabit Ethernet with the NDI codec. It delivers 1080i high-definition video at variable data rates typically around 100 Mbit/s.\\nBy default, NDI uses multicast DNS to advertise sources on a local area network, such that NDI receivers can automatically discover and offer those sources. It also supports two other discovery modes (NDI Access, NDI Discovery Server) that allow for operations across subnets and without multicast DNS. Sources are created using an arbitrarily selected TCP port from a range of ports on the NDI senders. When a source is requested, a TCP connection is established on the appropriate port with the NDI receiver connecting to the NDI sender. NDI 3.x has options to use UDP multicast or unicast with forward error correction (FEC) instead of TCP, and can load balance streams across multiple network interface controllers (NICs) without using link aggregation. NDI version 4.0 introduces the Multi-TCP transport.\\nNDI carries video, multichannel uncompressed audio, and metadata. Metadata messages can be sent in both directions allowing the sender and receiver to message one another over the connection with arbitrary metadata in XML form. This directional metadata system allows for functionality such as active tally information fed back to sources to understand that they are on-air. NDI also allows senders to determine the number of connected receivers, so they can skip unnecessary processing and network bandwidth utilisation when there are no NDI receiver clients connected. NDI Receivers can opt to connect to various combinations of streams, to support, for instance, audio-only or metadata-only connections where video is not required.\\nThe NDI software development kit (SDK) is available for Windows, Linux, and MacOS, and has also been ported to iOS, tvOS, Android, Raspberry Pi, and FPGA. The Standard NDI SDK is available via a royalty-free proprietary license. The NDI Advanced SDK offers OEMs direct access to and from compressed data and other features, with a commercial license.\\n\\n\\n== Comparison of common IP video protocols ==\\nOther IP video protocols for use in professional video production (rather than IP video used for distribution to end users) include SMPTE 2022, SMPTE 2110, ASPEN (largely superseded by SMPTE 2110) and Sony NMI. There are clear differences in the technology used by these protocols. \\n\\n\\n== History ==\\nNDI was publicly revealed by NewTek on 8 September 2015 and was demonstrated at the International Broadcasting Convention in Amsterdam that week.  The first device shown using NDI was the NewTek TriCaster which delivered an NDI feed from each of its SDI inputs as well as four output feeds from its vision mixer. The TriCaster could also receive up to two NDI sources from other devices.\\nNewTek had previously created a predecessor of NDI called AirSend to get video from external devices into their TriCaster products. AirSend had been implemented by a number of character generator (CG) vendors including Vizrt and Chyron. In order to quickly bring these products into the NDI space, NewTek created a new driver to replace the existing AirSend driver, which could be installed on these existing AirSend-compatible devices, instantly converting them to NDI-compatible devices with no change required by the original CG vendors.\\nBirdDog was an early adopter and in 2018 released Studio NDI, an ASIC implementation of NDI. BirdDog went on to deliver NDI PTZ cameras, along with a host of software applications.\\nAnother early adopter of NDI was VMix, a Windows-based vision mixer that offers NDI inputs and outputs.

A total of $1 billion in capital was pledged by Sam Altman, Greg Brockman, Elon Musk, Reid Hoffman, Jessica Livingston, Peter Thiel, Amazon Web Services (AWS), and Infosys. The actual collected total amount of contributions was only $130 million until 2019.\\nThe organization stated it would \"freely collaborate\" with other institutions and researchers by making some of its patents and research open to the public. OpenAI was initially run from Brockman\\'s living room. It was later headquartered at the Pioneer Building in the Mission District, San Francisco.\\nAccording to OpenAI\\'s charter, its founding mission is \"to ensure that artificial general intelligence (AGI)—by which we mean highly autonomous systems that outperform humans at most economically valuable work—benefits all of humanity.\"\\nMusk and Altman stated in 2015 that they were partly motivated by concerns about AI safety and existential risk from artificial general intelligence. OpenAI stated that \"it\\'s hard to fathom how much human-level AI could benefit society\", and that it is equally difficult to comprehend \"how much it could damage society if built or used incorrectly\". The startup also wrote that AI \"should be an extension of individual human wills and, in the spirit of liberty, as broadly and evenly distributed as possible\", and that \"because of AI\\'s surprising history, it\\'s hard to predict when human-level AI might come within reach. When it does, it\\'ll be important to have a leading research institution which can prioritize a good outcome for all over its own self-interest.\" Co-chair Sam Altman expected a decades-long project that eventually surpasses human intelligence.\\nBrockman met with Yoshua Bengio, one of the \"founding fathers\" of deep learning, and drew up a list great AI researchers. Brockman was able to hire nine of them as the first employees in December 2015. OpenAI did not pay AI researchers salaries comparable to those of Facebook or Google.

E. Kaiser, D. E. Perry, and W. M. Schell.\\nIn 1994, Grady Booch used the phrase continuous integration in Object-Oriented Analysis and Design with Applications (2nd edition) to explain how, when developing using micro processes, \"internal releases represent a sort of continuous integration of the system, and exist to force closure of the micro process\".\\nIn 1997, Kent Beck and Ron Jeffries invented extreme programming (XP) while on the Chrysler Comprehensive Compensation System project, including continuous integration. Beck published about continuous integration in 1998, emphasising the importance of face-to-face communication over technological support. In 1999, Beck elaborated more in his first full book on Extreme Programming.

While his post was originally met with skepticism, it quickly caught on and found widespread adoption as part of the lean software development methodology, also based on IMVU.\\n\\n\\n== Practices ==\\nThe core activities of CI are developers co-locate code changes in a shared, integration area frequently and that the resulting integrated codebase is verified for correctness. The first part generally involves merging changes to a common version control branch. The second part generally involves automated processes including: building, testing and many other processes.\\nTypically, a server builds from the integration area frequently; i.e. after each commit or periodically like once a day. The server may perform quality control checks such as running unit tests and collect software quality metrics via processes such as static analysis and performance testing.\\n\\n\\n=== Build automation ===\\n\\nBuild automation is a best practice. Build automation tools automate building. \\nProponents of CI recommend that a single command should have the capability of building the system. \\nAutomation often includes automating the integration, which often includes deployment into a production-like environment. In many cases, the build script not only compiles binaries but also generates documentation, website pages, statistics and distribution media (such as Debian DEB, Red Hat RPM or Windows MSI files).\\n\\n\\n=== Atomic commits ===\\nCI requires the version control system to support atomic commits; i.e., all of a developer\\'s changes are handled as a single commit.\\n\\n\\n=== Committing changes ===\\nWhen making a code change, a developer creates a branch that is a copy of the current codebase. As other changes are committed to the repository, this copy diverges from the latest version.\\nThe longer development continues on a branch without merging to the integration branch, the greater the risk of multiple integration conflicts and failures when the developer branch is eventually merged back. When developers submit code to the repository they must first update their code to reflect the changes in the repository since they took their copy. The more changes the repository contains, the more work developers must do before submitting their own changes.\\nEventually, the repository may become so different from the developers\\' baselines that they enter what is sometimes referred to as \"merge hell\", or \"integration hell\", '), Document(metadata={'title': 'Meteorology', 'summary': \"Meteorology is the scientific study of the Earth's atmosphere and short-term atmospheric phenomena (i.e., weather), with a focus on weather forecasting.

In 2005 and 2006, both Intel (VT-x) and AMD (AMD-V) introduced limited hardware virtualization support that allowed simpler virtualization software but offered very few speed benefits. Greater hardware support, which allowed substantial speed improvements, came with later processor models.\\n\\n\\n== Software-based virtualization ==\\nThe following discussion focuses only on virtualization of the x86 architecture protected mode.\\nIn protected mode the operating system kernel runs in kernel space at the most privileged level (ring 0) that allows it to configure the MMU, manage physical memory, and directly control I/O peripherals, while applications run in user space at a lower privilege level (such as ring 3), where they are confined to their own virtual address spaces and must invoke system calls to request I/O operations or other privileged services from the kernel.\\nIn software-based virtualization, a host OS has direct access to hardware while the guest operating systems, have limited access to hardware, similarly to other user space application of the host OS. One approach used in x86 software-based virtualization to implement this mechanism is called ring deprivileging, which involves running the guest OS at a ring higher (lesser privileged) than 0, so that attempts to execute privileged instructions can be intercepted and handled by the hypervisor.\\nThree techniques made virtualization of protected mode possible:\\n\\nBinary translation is used to rewrite certain ring 0 instructions in terms of ring 3 instructions, such as POPF, that would otherwise fail silently or behave differently when executed above ring 0, making the classic trap-and-emulate virtualization impossible. To improve performance, the translated basic blocks need to be cached in a coherent way that detects code patching (used in VxDs for instance), the reuse of pages by the guest OS, or even self-modifying code.\\nA number of key data structures used by a processor need to be shadowed. Because most operating systems use paged virtual memory, and granting the guest OS direct access to the MMU would mean loss of control by the virtualization manager, some of the work of the x86 MMU needs to be duplicated in software for the guest OS using a technique known as shadow page tables. This involves denying the guest OS any access to the actual page table entries by trapping access attempts and emulating them instead in software. The x86 architecture uses hidden state to store segment descriptors in the processor, so once the segment descriptors have been loaded into the processor, the memory from which they have been loaded may be overwritten and there is no way to get the descriptors back from the processor. Shadow descriptor tables must therefore be used to track changes made to the descriptor tables by the guest OS.\\nI/O device emulation: Unsupported devices on the guest OS must be emulated by a device emulator that runs in the host OS.\\nThese techniques incur some performance overhead due to lack of MMU virtualization support, as compared to a VM running on a natively virtualizable architecture such as the IBM System/370.\\nOn traditional mainframes, the classic type 1 hypervisor was self-standing and did not depend on any operating system or run any user applications itself. In contrast, the first x86 virtualization products were aimed at workstation computers, and ran a guest OS inside a host OS by embedding the hypervisor in a kernel module that ran under the host OS (type 2 hypervisor).\\nThere has been some controversy whether the x86 architecture with no hardware assistance is virtualizable as described by Popek and Goldberg.

      "\n",
      "Sometimes, even the smartest AI agents need a little human guidance. LangGraph allows you to easily integrate human input into the process. You can pause your AI agent, have a person check its plan, tweak things if needed, and then continue the workflow. This makes LangGraph perfect for creating reliable AI systems that need to be trusted in business settings—where AI can do most of the work, but a human keeps an eye on the really critical decisions. [...] Compared to other AI frameworks, LangGraph gives you more power and flexibility. If you’ve used LangChain before, you know it’s amazing for building chains of LLM-powered tasks, like calling an API or generating responses. LangGraph goes beyond those linear chains—it lets you create decision-making loops, pauses for human checks, and elaborate multi-agent setups.\n",

       "## Langgraph: A Strategic Game-Changer for Business Technology Alignment\n",
       "\n",
       "### Summary\n",
       "\n",
       "In the rapidly evolving landscape of AI and technology, businesses are constantly seeking innovative solutions to stay competitive. Langgraph emerges as a pivotal framework for enterprises aiming to align their business strategies with technological advancements. This report delves into the strategic advantages of adopting Langgraph, highlighting its potential to transform business models and maintain a competitive edge in the digital transformation race.\n",
       "\n",
       "Langgraph is not just a technical tool; it represents a strategic shift in how businesses can leverage AI for complex, real-world applications. Unlike its predecessor, LangChain, which is suitable for rapid development and straightforward applications, Langgraph is designed for sophisticated, production-grade AI systems. It excels in handling complex workflows, stateful processes, and multi-agent coordination, making it ideal for enterprises looking to implement robust AI solutions [1][2].\n",
       "\n",
       "One of the most compelling aspects of Langgraph is its ability to scale efficiently, offering better ROI for large-scale deployments. Its architecture supports modular, scalable systems with advanced memory management, error handling, and observability, crucial for mission-critical enterprise applications [1][3]. This makes Langgraph particularly appealing for industries such as retail, healthcare, and telecommunications, where real-world complexity and continuous change are prevalent [3][4].\n",
       "\n",
       "Langgraph's integration capabilities are another significant advantage. It seamlessly connects with major tools and models, including OpenAI, Anthropic, and enterprise APIs, allowing businesses to incorporate it into their existing tech stacks without significant overhead [5]. This flexibility ensures that companies can maintain their current workflows while enhancing them with Langgraph's advanced features.\n",
       "\n",
       "Moreover, Langgraph's strategic implications extend beyond technical benefits. It offers businesses a pathway to bridge the gap between automation and true personalization, particularly in sectors like retail, where customer interactions and operational efficiency are paramount [3]. By enabling more reliable, scalable, and stateful AI agents, Langgraph empowers businesses to move from static models to adaptive systems that learn and respond with context.\n",
       "\n",
       "In conclusion, Langgraph represents a strategic opportunity for businesses to harness the power of AI in a way that aligns with their long-term goals. Its robust framework, scalability, and integration capabilities make it a game-changer for enterprises looking to lead in the digital transformation era. As businesses continue to navigate the complexities of AI adoption, understanding and implementing Langgraph could be the key to unlocking new levels of innovation and competitiveness.\n",
